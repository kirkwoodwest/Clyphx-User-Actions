# Clyphx-User-Actions
A collection of User Actions I made for clyphx

Each File has their own instructions about how to use in the comments.

## Worm Control Presets
Apreset system that saves the 1st device on a collection of tracks into memory. The user can then load those presets with the LOAD action and one by one it loads them from the user library using clyphx.
